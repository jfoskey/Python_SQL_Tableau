# Python_SQL_Tableau
Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau to measure absenteeism in the worplace
-We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_new_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.
-Develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work.
-This will be a logistic regression model. Numerous machine learning tools and techniques will help us at this stage. At the end, we will store our work as a Python module that we will call ‘absenteeism_module’ and will thus preserve it in a form suitable for further analysis.
-Loading the ‘absenteeism_module’ and integrating Python and SQL:
In this section we will load the ‘absenteeism_module’ and use its methods to obtain predictions. Then, we will integrate Jupyter and MySQL Workbench to show you an example of how Python and SQL can be connected. At the end, we will export the final version of the data set as a *.csv file that will be ready for further analysis and visualization.
Analyzing the predicted outputs in Tableau:
Finally, we will use Tableau to analyse three separate dependencies between the inputs of our model. The visualizations we will obtain with this software will help us a great deal while looking for insights.
